Transform plugin for [livescript](https://github.com/gkz/LiveScript)

Converts unary clone operator ^^ to Object.create

This isn't real plugin because livescript doesn't have support for it. It's more like a hack thats is mutating AST generated by livescript.

# Usage
Assuming you have file name app.ls

simple use in livescript file
```livescript
require! <[ livescript-transform-object-create/register main]>
```

and in simple use in js file
```js
require ('livescript-transform-object-create/register')
require ('main') // this is livescript file
```

## CLI
Please stop using cli for any serious task, write scripts in **real** languages (there are so many to choose) e.g.  

    lsc serious-task.ls  
    node serious-task.js
    python serious-task.py

If you really must to use cli just add require plugin file to the command.  
But don't say I didn't warn you!

compiling

    lsc -cr livescript-transform-object-create/register app.ls


running

    node -r livescript-transform-object-create/register app.ls
